# Pinwheel

Pinwheel replaces a standard SELECT element with a Javascript-enhanced version that, when clicked, "pinwheels" outward to display the choices.

Pinwheel degrades gracefully: it reverts to the good ol' SELECT in the absence of Javascript.

Pinwheel requires the keen Prototype and Scriptaculous libraries. The versions used during development of Pinwheel are 1.6.0.2 and 1.8.1 respectively. Earlier versions of either library may work.
